        <h4>About</h4>
        <p>
          TickTock originated out of my love for the art of watchmaking. Recreating numerous pieces had provided design and development challenges which have culminated into this library. It should be noted though that TickTock is heavily dependent upon the design
          of the elements being animated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many complications in physical watches and clocks consist of rotating discs. Whether that be moonphases or date indicators, TickTock expects many of its components to be designed as a disc that will rotate from its center point. Transform origin points
          may need to be manually set in the CSS when rotating other elements, such as hands, for the time being.
        </p>
        <p>
          Understandably, this is a very niche library but I found myself wanting to re-use many of these components so why not open it up for others. I welcome contributions from others who also admire watchmaking.
