# Leap Year Indicator

A date anomaly occurring once every four years when an extra day is added to February (29th). It
ensures that the Gregorian calendar is in synch with Earthâ€™s revolutions around the sun, which is
almost 6 hours longer than 365 days. The Leap Year Indicator displays the current year's proximity
to the next (or current) leap year.

## Leap Year Indicator Settings

```ts
leapYear: {
    id: string;
    offsetMonths?: boolean;
    retrograde?: {
        max: number;
    };
    reverse?: boolean;
}
```

### `id` | Required

The DOM element ID of the Leap Year Indicator hand or disc.

| Props | Required | Type   | Default | Value(s)       |
| ----- | -------- | ------ | ------- | -------------- |
| `id`  | Yes      | string | -       | DOM Element ID |

### `offsetMonths`

By default, the Leap Year Indicator will rotate in 25% increments to the the appropriate year
position within a 4-year cycle. However, when `offsetMonths` is `true`, the indicator will rotate an
additional amount corresponding the current month of the year.

| Props          | Required | Type    | Default | Value(s)     |
| -------------- | -------- | ------- | ------- | ------------ |
| `offsetMonths` | No       | boolean | False   | True / False |

### `retrograde`

The DOM element ID of the retrograde Leap Year Indicator hand or disc.

| Props            | Required | Type   | Default | Value(s)                                                                                      |
| ---------------- | -------- | ------ | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `retrograde.max` | Yes      | number | -       | The maximum rotation in degrees to reach the fourth year of the display. Often `90` or `180`. |

### `reverse`

By default, Horologist will rotate elements in a clockwise direction. Use the `reverse` prop to
rotate the elements counter-clockwise.

| Props     | Required | Type    | Default | Value(s)     |
| --------- | -------- | ------- | ------- | ------------ |
| `reverse` | No       | boolean | False   | True / False |

## Design Considerations

When designing a Leap Year Indicator to work with Horologist, there are a few considerations to keep
in mind.

1. The Leap Year Indicator should be drawn at its starting position of Year 1.
2. Horologist does not assign any `transition-origin` properties. These must be defined manually.

## Leap Year Indicator Functionality

When including a Leap Year Indicator, the current year will be shown as year a particular year
within a four-year cycle. Years 1, 2, 3 and 4, which is the leap year.
